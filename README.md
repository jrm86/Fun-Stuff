# Fun Stuff

Nothing too fancy here. Just a place to put little things I do when I have a few minutes and need a break from homework. Eventually I'll fill this out more with some more content in regard to what's stored here (where applicable).

At the moment, there's a Processing script which animates interesting properties of rational or irrational numbers. It was inspired by [this video on Numpherphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8Sg8qnjOg).
You can pause the animation using the spacebar, and jump in hundredths or thousanths of a turn using the up/down and left/right keys, respectively.
